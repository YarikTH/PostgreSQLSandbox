# PostgreSQLSandbox
Personal sandbox to check how to use PostgreSQL from C++

## TODO

Try not to use libpqxx as a submodule, but as fetch_content instead. See https://github.com/YarikTH/ureact/tree/main/tests/integration/cmake_fetch_content

Try to automatically copy needed libs from "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin" or force user to have them
in the PATH

Add fmt library because it is must have library.
